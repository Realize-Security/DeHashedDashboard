# Vue 3 + TypeScript + Vite + Express

> Note: This is a work in progress and does NOT include authentication. 

An example Vue.js PoC for integrating with the Dehashed API. The project uses an Express server backend to route API rerquests from the Vue.js UI to query Dehashed without exposing the Dehashed API key to the client. Both server and client use a shared TypeScript repo which includes common types for API requests and responses.
